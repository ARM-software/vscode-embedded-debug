# Arm Embedded Debugger

## Overview

The complete [documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Extension-pack-and-extensions) for Arm® Embedded Debugger and the other Keil® Studio extensions is available on Arm Developer.

The Embedded Debugger extension allows you to run and debug projects on Arm Cortex®-M based microcontrollers, development boards, and debug probes implementing the Microsoft Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP). You can install the extension individually or as part of the Arm Keil Studio Pack extension in Visual Studio Code Desktop.

We recommend installing the [Keil Studio Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) for Visual Studio Code Desktop to quickly set up your environment. You can then [import a solution example from keil.arm.com](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Get-started-with-an-example-project/Import-a-solution-example), [download and convert a μVision project from keil.arm.com](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Get-started-with-an-example-project/Download-and-convert-a-Keil--Vision-example), [create a solution from scratch](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Arm-CMSIS-Solution-extension/Create-a-solution), or [convert an existing μVision project](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Arm-CMSIS-Solution-extension/Convert-a-Keil--Vision-project-to-a-solution).

The Embedded Debugger extension can work in combination with the Arm Device Manager (Identifier: `arm.device-manager`) and Arm CMSIS Solution (Identifier: `arm.cmsis-csolution`) extensions.
